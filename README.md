RPI Thesis (M.Sc/Ph.D.) LyX Template
================

This template was created using the latest version of the thesis guidelines for grad students at RPI (as of 2020). It is recommended to install LyX alongside TeXLive or an equivalent distribution.

The contents of the thesis are organized chapterwise so that each chapter can be edited and compiled on its own. Please be aware that the final output differs since the main file (`00_MSc_Thesis_Template.lyx`) incorporates additional features of RPI guidelines.

Bibliography is managed using biblatex and a single `.bib` file in `99_Refs`. You can change the style by editing the last part of the preamble (`rpi_template_preamble.tex`). Check [here](overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_bibliography_styles) for more compatible styles.

Note that when compiling a single chapter individually, the citations will not be formatted. However, they are meant to be on the specified format for the final document.
